# Grids
#  - Must include 'default'
#  - All grids are expected to be defined in one projection
#  - If only footprint data is available use shape: [1,1] and
#    compute corresponding transform from the footrprint.
#  - shape: [Height, Width] of image plane
#  - transform: Affine matrix in row-major order, mapping from
#    pixel plane coordinates to world

  default:
      shape: [7731, 7621]
      transform: [30.0, 0.0, 306285.0, 0.0, -30.0, -1802085.0, 0, 0, 1]

# Lineage: Dict[str, List[UUID]]
#  - Lineage is for immediate parents only
#  - Order of UUIDs within a list is not significant
#  - Allows multiple parents to have same label unlike current format
#     This requires changing constraint on dataset_source:classifier
#  - Constraints interop for OLD code + new DB
#  - Possibly change to just str:UUID mapping for backwards compatibility if too hard
