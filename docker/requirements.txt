# This file is used to download all dependencies
#
# Majority of dependencies will be pulled in via `-e /code/...`, but some
# extras are needed:
#  - test dependencies that are not listed as direct dependencies
#  - libraries that need extra features enabled (dask[complete], datacube[dev])
#  - optional dependencies that are needed to run tests more fully (hdstats)
#  - libraries that we need to constrain versions for to help pip resolutions
#

# things needed for tests that might not be referenced in setup.py
deepdiff
moto
mock
docker
pytest-depends
pip-tools
rio-cogeo

# needed to bootstrap environment without network index
wheel
setuptools
pip

datacube[dev]==1.8.4

# hdstats is optional, needs to be pulled in manually
hdstats

# need to constrain this one for pip-sake
# Fixing this allows pip resolution without constraints.txt
aiobotocore[boto3,awscli]==1.3.3

# Make sure dask has all the features enabled
dask[complete]

# not needed for python 3.8 and up, and are not installed,
# but `pip check` doesn't know better
dataclasses

# This section should list all odc libs to be installed for testing including
# desired feature flags.
#
# These are used to pull in dependencies, but are then discarded
